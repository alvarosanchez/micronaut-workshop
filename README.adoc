Introductory workshop about http://micronaut.io[Micronaut].

== Software Requirements

In order to do this workshop, you need the following:

=== Clone this repository

Once done, you can clone this repo:

----
git clone https://github.com/alvarosanchez/micronaut-workshop.git

NOTE: You will find each exercise's template files on each `exNN` folder. Solution is always inside a `solution` folder. To highlight the actions you actually need to perform, an icon is used: icon:hand-o-right[]

== Application architecture 

Throughout this workshop, we will be creating a football (soccer) management system.

* `clubs` is the microservice responsible for managing clubs. It uses Hibernate 
  as a data access layer.
* `fixtures` manages all game fixtures, storing its data in MongoDB. For the 
  teams playing in a game, it doesn't store their full details, but rather their 
  ID. It has a service-discovery-enabled HTTP client to fetch club details from 
  the `clubs` microservice.
