== Implementing a data access layer with Micronaut Data JDBC (15 minutes)

TIP: Change to the `lab01` directory to work on this exercise

In this exercise, you will create a data access layer
using https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-data/latest/guide/[Micronaut Data JDBC]. This library provides a
convenient way to create repositories that can be used to perform CRUD operations on a database.

=== Preparing the database (5 minutes)

Before going any further, make sure you have a recent version of `postgres:latest` pulled in your Docker environment.

icon:hand-o-right[] Execute the following command

  docker pull postgres:latest

Also, to setup the schema and add some sample data, we are going to use https://flywaydb.org/[Flyway] via its
https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-flyway[Micronaut Flyway integration].
