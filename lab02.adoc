== Implementing a data access layer with Micronaut Data JDBC (15 minutes)

TIP: Change to the `lab02` directory to work on this exercise

In this exercise, you will create a data access layer
using https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-data/latest/guide/[Micronaut Data JDBC]. This library provides a
convenient way to create repositories that can be used to perform CRUD operations on a database.

For development and testing on a real database, we are going to use https://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL] via
https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test-resources/latest/guide/[Micronaut Test Resources].

=== Preparing the database (10 minutes)

Before going any further, make sure you have a recent version of `postgres:latest` pulled in your Docker environment.

icon:hand-o-right[] Execute the following command

  docker pull postgres:latest

Also, to setup the schema and add some sample data, we are going to use https://flywaydb.org/[Flyway] via its
https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-flyway[Micronaut Flyway integration].

icon:hand-o-right[] Create the following migration files:

[%collapsible]
====
.`src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__schema.sql`
[source,sql]
----
include::./lab02/solution/clubs/src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__schema.sql[]
----

.`src/main/resources/db/migration/V2__data.sql`
[source,sql]
----
include::./lab02/solution/clubs/src/main/resources/db/migration/V2__data.sql[]
----
====

At this point, you should be able to run the application and see if the migrations are applied. When using the
Micronaut Maven Plugin's `mn:run` goal, a Test Resources service will be started automatically, so that required
containers are run before the application is running.

icon:hand-o-right[] Execute the following command

  ./mvnw mn:run

You should see the following output:

[source,console]
----
...
[info] Starting Micronaut Test Resources service, version 2.0.0
[test-resources-service] 08:10:56.830 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-9] INFO  i.m.t.e.TestResourcesResolverLoader - Loaded 2 test resources resolvers: io.micronaut.testresources.postgres.PostgreSQLTestResourceProvider, io.micronaut.testresources.testcontainers.GenericTestContainerProvider

functional tests.

=== Implementing the data access layer (20 minutes)

For the data access layer, we are going to use the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-data/latest/guide/#jdbc[Micronaut Data] library in its JDBC flavour. In the source code, we will use
standard JPA annotations.

icon:hand-o-right[] Add the following dependency:

[source,xml]
----
include::./lab02/solution/clubs/pom.xml[tag=jpa,indent=0]
----
<1> It is in `provided` scope so that is available during compilation, so that the Micronaut annotation processor can
    generate the corresponding beans, but it is not included in the final JAR since at runtime we will not use JPA but
    Micronaut Data JDBC.

==== Creating the entity model and repository (10 minutes)

icon:hand-o-right[] Create the following entity model:

ifdef::generate-diagrams[]
[plantuml, entity-model, png]
....
entity Club <<record>> {
  id: Long
  name: String
  stadium: String
}
note top of Club
  @Entity
  @Serdeable
end note
note right of Club::id
  @Id
  @GeneratedValue
end note

interface CrudRepository {}
interface ClubRepository<Club, Long> {}
note top of ClubRepository
  @JdbcRepository(dialect = Dialect.POSTGRES)
end note
CrudRepository <|-- ClubRepository
ClubRepository -- Club : uses
....
endif::[]

We can write a simple test to make sure everything is working as expected.

icon:hand-o-right[] Create the following test:
