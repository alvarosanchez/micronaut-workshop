== Getting started with Micronaut and GraalVM (~30 minutes)

TIP: Change to the `lab01` directory to work on this exercise

There are multiple ways to create a new Micronaut application:

1. Using the https://micronaut.io/launch/[Micronaut Launch] web application.
2. Using the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-starter/latest/guide/#installation[Micronaut `mn` CLI].
3. Using `curl` against the `launch.micronaut.io` API to download a ZIP.

=== Using Micronaut Launch to create a new application (5 minutes)

We will use the third option, so that you can copy/paste the commands.

icon:hand-o-right[] To see the options available, run:

  curl https://launch.micronaut.io

Micronaut Launch uses _features_ as building blocks to create a new application. Features can contribute to the
application in different ways, such as adding build dependencies, configuration properties, sample code, etc.

icon:hand-o-right[] Let's create a new application with the following command:

  curl 'https://launch.micronaut.io/create/default/com.example.micronaut.hello?lang=JAVA&build=MAVEN&test=JUNIT&javaVersion=JDK_21&features=graalvm&features=control-panel' --output hello.zip

You can now unzip the file and open the resulting folder in your IDE.

=== Running the application with the Micronaut Maven Plugin (5 minutes)

The https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-maven-plugin[Micronaut Maven Plugin] provides a convenient way to
run your application from the command line.

icon:hand-o-right[] To run the application, execute:

  ./mvnw mn:run

You can leave the application running while you work on the rest of the exercise, since the plugin will automatically
restart the application when it detects changes in the source code.

TIP: Micronaut applications can also be run from the IDE. Refer to the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#ideSetup[IDE Setup] section of the Micronaut documentation for more details.

=== Creating a Hello World controller (5 minutes)

icon:hand-o-right[] Create a new controller with a single endpoint `/hello/{name}` that returns a greeting message using
the provided path variable.

====
[source,java]
----
include::./lab01/solution/hello/src/main/java/com/example/micronaut/HelloController.java[tag=class]
----
<1> The `@Controller` annotation marks this class as a controller on the default `/` route.
<2> The `@Get` annotation marks this method as a `GET` endpoint on the `/hello/{name}` route
<3> The `name` parameter matches the path variable in the route. A typo in either of them will result in a compilation
error.
====

=== Testing the application (5 minutes)

Since the application is still running, you can test it using `curl`:

icon:hand-o-right[] Open a new terminal and run:

  curl http://localhost:8080/hello/World

While manual testing is useful, writing an automated functional test is even better. Micronaut provides a super-fast
and convenient way to write functional tests using the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test/latest/guide/[Micronaut Test] library.

Generated applications include a sample test that asserts that the application startups successfully.

icon:hand-o-right[] Open `src/test/java/com/example/micronaut/HelloTest.java` and add a new test that asserts that the
`/hello/{name}` endpoint returns a greeting message.

====
[source,java]
----
include::./lab01/solution/hello/src/test/java/com/example/micronaut/HelloTest.java[tag=test]
----
<1> The `@Client("/")` annotation will inject an HTTP client connected to the embedded server random port.

====

Before running the test, let's add a Logback logger to see the details of the HTTP client.

icon:hand-o-right[] Open `src/main/resources/logback.xml` and add the following logger:

[source,xml]
----
include::./lab01/solution/hello/src/main/resources/logback.xml[tag=logger,indent=0]
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Now you can run the test from your IDE or from the command line:

  ./mvnw test

=== Packaging the application into different formats (10 minutes)

The Micronaut Maven Plugin provides a convenient way to package your application into different formats, such as a fat JAR,
a Docker image, or a native executable. For more details, refer to the
https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-maven-plugin/latest/examples/package.html[Packaging] section of the Micronaut
Maven Plugin documentation.

icon:hand-o-right[] To create a fat JAR, run:

  ./mvnw package

icon:hand-o-right[] Once finished, you can run the JAR:

      java -jar target/hello-0.1.jar

icon:hand-o-right[] To create a Docker image, run:

    ./mvnw clean package -Dpackaging=docker

icon:hand-o-right[] Once finished, you can run the Docker image:

    docker run -p 8080:8080 hello

Micronaut applications can be compiled to native executables using GraalVM. This allows you to create a single
self-contained executable that can be run without a JVM.

icon:hand-o-right[] To generate a native executable, run:

  ./mvnw clean package -Dpackaging=native-image

On modern hardware, this should take about one minute.

icon:hand-o-right[] Once finished, you can run the executable:

  ./target/hello

You will see that Micronaut starts in a few milliseconds.

icon:hand-o-right[] Test the application again with `curl`:

  curl http://localhost:8080/hello/World

=== Exploring the Micronaut Control Panel (5 minutes)

The Micronaut Control Panel module provides a web UI that allows you to view and manage the state of your Micronaut
application, typically in a development environment.

The `control-panel` feature was added when we created the application using Micronaut Launch, so all you need to do is
run the application and open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/control-panel[]

     for more details.
